# Descrption
This Python cli app allows user to play the classic Tower of Hanoi game. It is used to help demonstrate the computer science topics of nodes, lists, and stacks

## How to play
The objective of the game is to move the stack of disks from the leftmost stack to the rightmost stack.

The game follows three rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
